# The dead of Sandboxie

I was a long time Sandboxie user (by Invincea), until [Sophos took over it](https://community.sophos.com/products/sandboxie/f/forum/115109/major-sandboxie-news-sandboxie-is-now-a-free-tool-with-plans-to-transition-it-to-an-open-source-tool/), which was in my opinion a bad decision. Sandboxie is currently freeware and the Sophos team [promised to open source it](https://community.sophos.com/products/sandboxie/f/forum/115109/major-sandboxie-news-sandboxie-is-now-a-free-tool-with-plans-to-transition-it-to-an-open-source-tool/).


## Download

The latest (free) version v5.31.4 can be downloaded from [here](https://www.sandboxie.com/DownloadSandboxie). You can fill-in fake [eMail](https://temp-mail.org/) data to get to the real download links (I'm not permitted to post any direct download URL). The official forum can be found over [here](https://community.sophos.com/products/sandboxie/f/forum) (no login required).



## Paid customers f*ck'ed again?
This what happens to Sandboxie right now is a perfect example why online activation should be illegal to begin with. _I have a lifetime license for Sandboxie_. The application license term has no expiration date. This reminds me on the old AnyDVD story, they did not converted by license to their "HD version" (basically they renamed it to avoid giving old customers a new lic.).

### Refund?
Not possible because the EULA changed during the time I bought Sandboxie and I can't recall the EULA verbiage from for X years.


## Yay! Open Source!

Well, I did not (yet) found any source code, there is a promise but that's it (for now). Of course, this can change however I believe that will not go well. The reasons are obvious, maintaining such a program is a huge task and most people just don't want to spent that much time on testing, developing and improving the product.

Sophos wrote that sandboxie is not their main priority and this worries me, they might integrate it into one of their products which then forces you to use their solution. I see that someone could compile (based on the source code leak) his own binary, however it's unclear if Sophos really uploads an "untouched" version or if its bound together with something else which would make it even harder to _get the original sandoxie_ program back.

## Alternatives?

Not much, Windows 10 got his own "sandbox". Sandboxies concept is (or was) not bad, however keep in mind that the program itself is from XP ages, nowdays we are using hardware virtualization as sandbox solution, not software (like sandboxie does). Alternatives are Comodo, 360, Windows or software with [hardened security feaures](https://www.bromium.com/our-tech/bromium-secure-platform/). On Linux there is basically only Firejail.


## Why this repo?

Well, I'm (again) disappointed and it makes me "_angry_" that paid customers are "screwed" again (yes it's now freeware, yes it will be ]open source'd](https://community.sophos.com/products/sandboxie/f/forum/115109/major-sandboxie-news-sandboxie-is-now-a-free-tool-with-plans-to-transition-it-to-an-open-source-tool) - _I get that_). As said, I'm worried that no one is really working with the souce code (once it was finally uploaded). Personally, I _hope_ Microsoft improves their own Windows Sandbox solution....
